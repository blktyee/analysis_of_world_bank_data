# Q9 (1 point) Complete lazy_commit bash function(look for how to write bash functions) to add, commit and push to the remote master.
# In the command prompt, this function is used as
#
# lazygit file_1 file_2 ... file_n commit_message
#
# This bash function must take files name and commit message as positional parameters
# and perform followling git function
#
# git add file_1 file_2 .. file_n
# git commit -m commit_message
# git push origin master

#
# Side: In the Linux if we put this function in .bashrc hidden file in
# the user home directory(type cd ~ to go to the home directory) and source .bashrc after adding this function,
# lazy_commit should be available in the command prompt.
# One can type lazy_commit file1 file2 ... filen  commit_message
# and file will be added , commited and pushed to remote master using one lazy_commit command.
